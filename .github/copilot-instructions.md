# Data Analysis and Prediction Project - Copilot Instructions

This is a Python data science project focused on data analysis, machine learning predictions, and data visualization.

## Project Structure
- `src/analysis/`: Data analysis and statistical functions
- `src/models/`: Machine learning models and prediction algorithms
- `src/visualization/`: Plotting and charting utilities
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions for data processing
- `data/`: Dataset storage
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration
- `outputs/`: Generated plots and results

## Key Libraries Used
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: Numerical computing
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
- matplotlib & seaborn: Static visualizations
- plotly: Interactive visualizations
- scipy: Statistical functions
- jupyter: Interactive notebooks

## Coding Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include comprehensive docstrings
- Add error handling for file operations
- Use descriptive variable names
- Implement proper logging for debugging

## Best Practices
- Always validate input data before processing
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Scale features for machine learning models
- Use cross-validation for model evaluation
- Save visualizations with high DPI for presentations
- Include performance metrics in model outputs
- Create reproducible results with random seeds
